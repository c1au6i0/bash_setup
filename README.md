# BASH and VIM set up

This is just a copy of the .bashrc and .vimrc files that I used on servers.

General Set up:

- Install [oh-my-bash](https://github.com/ohmybash/oh-my-bash).
- Install [Bioconda](https://github.com/ohmybash/oh-my-bash).
- Install [mamba](https://github.com/mamba-org/mamba):
`mamba install xtensor-r -c conda-forge`
- Copy `.bashrc` and `.vimrc` in home directory.
- Install [vim-plug](https://github.com/junegunn/vim-plug).
Start `vim` and `:PlugUpdate` to install plugins.
